A simple todo app created as a part of learning and understanding node.js

to run this web app on your local machine first you must have node.js installed on your computer.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v0.12.7 or above

once you have installed the node.js run :
``
npm install
``
and to run the server simply run this line of code :
``
node app
``
if you done all the steps correctly the app should be running well at [localhost:7080] (http://localhost:7080)

Thanks for trying it out and don't forget to send me feedbacks!
